  "overview": "This upcoming project will be part of EG-361: Introduction to Autonomous Robots. In this course, we will be working with pre-built four-wheel robotic cars and will focus on developing the programming necessary to control their movement. This includes coordinating the wheels to drive in a straight line, execute turns, and navigate through intersections. A PixyCam2 will be mounted on each car to detect the state of a stoplight, allowing the robot to make stop-and-go decisions in response to its environment. The goal of the project is to apply fundamental robotics and computer vision concepts to create a functional autonomous system capable of interacting with its surroundings.",
