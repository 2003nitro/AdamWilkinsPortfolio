  "overview": "This project idea is to build a discord bot (using discord as the front end) to track filament for my 3d printer. I plan to have color, brand, style (silk, matte, etc.), in stock, and links to buy as the data for each filamnet with a specific number. The idea is to have a wall of benchys and filamnet swatches that have numbers to identify each individual filament. I will be able to search for the exact filamnet I want using the discord bot or I can select one from the wall and search the number to quickly identify if I have it in stock and which one it is.",
